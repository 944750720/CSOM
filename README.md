# CSOM
Based on https://github.com/JustGlowing/miniso.
In order to classify goals by unsupervised-learning, I am using SOM (Self organizing maps neural network) to process MIMO-FMCW radar. We can see the reflector is the deep purple field on the left side of radar heatmap. And I am coding the complex-value SOM to make better use of the amplititude and phase data of radar.
